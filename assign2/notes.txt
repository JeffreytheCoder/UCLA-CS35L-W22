1. expression to compute 7^(5^4)
(expt 7 (expt 5 4))

2. expression to determine how many bits to store 7^(5^4)
(hint: consider using `log` to simplify your computation)
(+ (truncate (log (expt 7 (expt 5 4)) 2)) 1)
It takes 61 bits to store 7^(5^4)

3. C-h k C-h k describe what happens and why
It describes the key "C-h k" on how it can be used to describe keys

4. C-h k M-SPC describe what happens and why, how M-SPC works
It describe how "M-SPC" can be used to insert just one space

5. the general way to do M-SPC (whatâ€™s that general function)
M-x cycle-spacing

Optional
1. What happens when this script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, and why?
It outputs nothing since the file is empty

2. What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2, and why? (You can run Python 3 on the SEASnet hosts by using the command python3 instead of python2.)
It reports syntax error on match case since it's only avaliable after Python3.10
